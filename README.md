# jokes-generator
This is a quick android app I made to generate funny jokes off the internet.

Since this year, due to the pandemic, we are not able to attend in-person hackathons and competition, I decided to challenge myself and made this app within 24 hours.
The goal of this project was to make a functional app in 24 hours, hence it is a very simple app that calls an API to get data on jokes. 

Here is the link to the github repo of the API: https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api 

To try out the app, download the "Jokes Generator.apk" file and install to run.
