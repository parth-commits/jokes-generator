    <string name="info">There are a lot of websites and apps out there that provide users with latest COVID-19 data. But they all have one thing in common, they all have ADs. These ADs ruin the user experience of quickly updating themselves on the latest cases and more. So this app was created to strip down the data to the basics with NO Ads! Horray!</string>
